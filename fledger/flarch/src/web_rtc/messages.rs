//! # Messages for WebRTC connections
//!
//! This is a list of messages that are used by the [`crate::web_rtc::WebRTCConn`] and
//! [`crate::web_rtc::node_connection::NodeConnection`] brokers to communicate with the libc and wasm implementations
//! of the WebRTC subsystem.
//! Both the wasm and the libc implementation for the WebRTC system return a [`Broker<WebRTCInput, WebRTCOutput>`]
//! that is then given to the [`crate::web_rtc::WebRTCConn`].
