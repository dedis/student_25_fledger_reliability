# Template

This template shows how to write the three parts of a module (core, messages, translation).
The messages for this module allow it to increment a counter, and to share it with the other
nodes in the system.
It shows how to use a configuration and how to have persistent storage across node reboots.

## Usage instructions

Copy this directory and name it after the module you want to create.
Then search and replace `Template` with the name of your module.
