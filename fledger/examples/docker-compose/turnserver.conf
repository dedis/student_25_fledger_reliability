# Coturn turn server configuration file - EXAMPLE FOR FLEDGER USE!
# Please look at the original at https://github.com/coturn/coturn for
# more options.

# 'Static' user accounts for the long term credentials mechanism, only.
# This option cannot be used with TURN REST API.
# 'Static' user accounts are NOT dynamically checked by the turnserver process,
# so they can NOT be changed while the turnserver is running.
#
#user=username1:key1
#user=username2:key2
# OR:
#user=username1:password1
#user=username2:password2
user=something:something
#
# Keys must be generated by turnadmin utility. The key value depends
# on user name, realm, and password:
#
# Example:
# $ turnadmin -k -u ninefingers -r north.gov -p youhavetoberealistic
# Output: 0xbc807ee29df3c9ffa736523fb2c4e8ee
# ('0x' in the beginning of the key is what differentiates the key from
# password. If it has 0x then it is a key, otherwise it is a password).
#
# The corresponding user account entry in the config file will be:
#
#user=ninefingers:0xbc807ee29df3c9ffa736523fb2c4e8ee
# Or, equivalently, with open clear password (less secure):
#user=ninefingers:youhavetoberealistic
#

# The default realm to be used for the users when no explicit
# origin/realm relationship is found in the database, or if the TURN
# server is not using any database (just the commands-line settings
# and the userdb file). Must be used with long-term credentials
# mechanism or with TURN REST API.
#
# Note: If the default realm is not specified, then realm falls back to the host domain name.
#       If the domain name string is empty, or set to '(None)', then it is initialized as an empty string.
#
realm=web.fledg.re

# TURN server allocates address family according TURN client requested address family.
# If address family not requested explicitly by the client, then it falls back to this default.
# The standard RFC explicitly define that this default must be IPv4, 
# so use other option values with care! 
# Possible values: "ipv4" or "ipv6" or "keep" 
# "keep" sets the allocation default address family according to 
# the TURN client allocation request connection address family.
#allocation-default-address-family="ipv4"
allocation-default-address-family="ipv4"

# Disable RFC5780 (NAT behavior discovery).
#
# Originally, if there are more than one listener address from the same
# address family, then by default the NAT behavior discovery feature enabled.
# This option disables the original behavior, because the NAT behavior
# discovery adds extra attributes to response, and this increase the
# possibility of an amplification attack.
#
# Strongly encouraged to use this option to decrease gain factor in STUN
# binding responses.

# Disable handling old STUN Binding requests and disable MAPPED-ADDRESS
# attribute in binding response (use only the XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS).
#
# Strongly encouraged to use this option to decrease gain factor in STUN
# binding responses.

# Only send RESPONSE-ORIGIN attribute in binding response if RFC5780 is enabled.
